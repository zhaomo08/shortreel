"""v12 → v13: backfill typed provenance onto legacy media records, then re-activate the manifest.

Video version records written before typed provenance existed cannot be
registered by the manifest planner nor read by the presentation read model.
This step projects the missing facts from the project as it stands now (the
same projection the currency comparison uses), stamps each amended record with
``provenance_backfilled_at``, and replaces the whole manifest from a fresh
plan so the videos those records back are registered current. Scripts whose
formal script_plan slot is empty are registered on a plan-less basis by the
same plan.

Order matters: the record amendment is a plain versions.json rewrite that
precedes the activation preflight, so the plan reads the amended bytes and the
activation's stability gate holds them fixed through the commit.
