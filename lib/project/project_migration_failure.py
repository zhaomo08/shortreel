"""Persistent record of a failed project schema migration.

A project whose migration chain (including artifact backfill) did not finish is
a blocking project-level problem: its production status, its production plan and
every generation entry report the same failure until it is repaired and retried.
The record lives beside ``project.json`` so the verdict survives restarts and is
readable by any consumer without a database round trip — the startup runner is
the only writer, plus the agent-facing retry tool.

Absence of the record does not mean "not blocked": a project short of the
current schema has no backfilled artifact claims to read either way, so
:func:`load_migration_verdict` reports it blocked on the schema discriminator
alone. Only an actual failed attempt writes a record, and that record wins
because it names the exact inputs to repair.
