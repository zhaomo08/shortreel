"""All-or-nothing pre-request admission for batch video generation.

A batch video request evaluates every target once — speech composition, the
optional TTS choice, the request projection and its quote — and then either
creates the whole task set or none of it.  This module owns the transport
neutral part of that: the per-unit verdict, the folding rule, the aggregate
confirmation summary, and how a refusal is written into the
``requested / succeeded / failed / blocked`` contract.

Collecting the current project, TTS, provider and queue state is the adapter's
job (:mod:`server.services.admission.video_batch_admission`); nothing here reads the
filesystem, the database or the queue.

The decision is a pre-request gate and says nothing about execution outcomes:
once a batch is admitted, individual tasks may still succeed or fail, and that
is reported through :class:`lib.generation.generation_result.GenerationBatchResult` as
usual.
