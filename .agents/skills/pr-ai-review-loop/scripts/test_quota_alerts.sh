# test_quota_alerts.sh — regression test for poll.sh's quota_alerts detection and
# the CodeRabbit rate-limit banner match (cr_rate_limited_body, which also backs
# walkthrough.is_rate_limited / reviewed_current_head suppression).
#
# USAGE
#   bash test_quota_alerts.sh
#
# Extracts the `cr_rate_limited_body`, `quota_alerts` and `cr_walkthrough_rest`
# jq defs verbatim out of poll.sh (so this test always exercises the functions
# actually shipped, not a copy that can drift) and runs them against fixture
# comment bodies in testdata/. `cr_walkthrough_rest` is exercised because the
# banner match alone is not the guarantee that matters: what the loop reads is
# the walkthrough projection, and a rate-limited body must surface there as
# is_rate_limited=true AND reviewed_current_head=false even when updated_at is
# newer than the last push. The fixtures:
#   - quota_alert_pr1115_no_stack.txt / quota_alert_pr1115_review_stack.txt: real
#     CodeRabbit rate-limit banners captured from the source PR's walkthrough
#     comment edit history (GraphQL userContentEdits — the live GitHub body has
#     since been overwritten by CodeRabbit's own later edits, so this is the only
#     way to recover the exact bytes). *_review_stack carries the change-stack
#     link banner that pushes the alert phrase past the old 500-char scan window —
#     this is the exact silent-miss regression this test guards against.
#   - no_actionable_pr1115.txt: the same PR's final (non-alert) walkthrough body,
#     also real, sharing the same change-stack banner prefix — proves the fix
#     doesn't start matching on the banner alone.
#   - synthetic_non_alert_mentions_limit.txt: constructed (not captured from a
#     real PR) edge case where the body merely discusses rate limiting as a
#     topic, to check bare keyword mentions still don't trigger.
