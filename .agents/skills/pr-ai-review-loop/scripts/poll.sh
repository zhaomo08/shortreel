#!/usr/bin/env bash
# poll.sh — pull all AI reviewer state for a PR in one shot; emit a MINIMAL INDEX on
# stdout and stage the FULL SNAPSHOT to a temp file for query.sh (layer-2 lookups).
#
# USAGE
#   bash poll.sh --repo-root <path> <PR_NUMBER>
#
# OUTPUT
#   stdout   — minimal index JSON (schema below), semi-compact: containers expand one key
#              per line, row objects stay on one line each. When the derived index is
#              identical to the last fully-printed one, a single line replaces it:
#                {no_change: true, head, last_push_at, unchanged_since, hint}
#              unchanged_since = printed_at of the last full print, so it tells how long
#              the state has been flat. Recover the full index anytime (e.g. after context
#              compaction) via `query.sh <PR> index`. The comparison covers the DERIVED
#              INDEX only; the snapshot is still refreshed every poll, so query.sh always
#              reads current bodies. Errors to stderr prefixed `POLL_ERROR:`.
#   snapshot — full-body JSON at ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/pr-ai-review-loop-<uid>/poll-<owner>-<repo>-<PR>.json
#              (user-private 0700 subdir), atomically overwritten on every poll. The snapshot
#              carries no cross-round state: it materializes THIS poll's fetch and is fully
#              rebuilt by re-running poll.sh. query.sh is its only intended reader.
#   index    — last fully-printed index plus its printed_at, at <snapshot>.index.json;
#              backs the no_change comparison and `query.sh index`.
#   rounds   — per-PR round ledger written by round.sh at <snapshot>.rounds.json; poll.sh reads
#              its entry count and the last marked_at (the pushback-only watermark, see PITFALL 8).
#   seen     — per-PR ledger of every comment/review id observed by any earlier poll, at
#              <snapshot>.seen.json; backs the straggler half of is_new (see PITFALL 6).
#
# WHY THE INDEX/SNAPSHOT LAYERS EXIST
#   The looper's context budget is a first-class limit, alongside wall-clock time. Repeatedly
#   injecting review bodies causes attention drift; once the looper loses the thread, the
#   whole review loop must be handed to a fresh agent. Preserve these invariants:
#   1. stdout is the smallest decision index: new body-bearing entries expose id, flags,
#      and a 120-character preview; old entries collapse to counts; bodies never appear.
#   2. the full text lives only in the snapshot and query.sh retrieves it by id on demand.
#   3. a derived index identical to the previous full print collapses to `no_change`.

#   reviewed_current_head  walkthrough.updated_at > last_push_at AND is_rate_limited == false AND a commit anchor
#                          matches the head: walkthrough_head when the body carries one, else the latest CR
#                          review's commit (null = no evidence either way, timestamp rule alone). CR rewrites its
#                          first comment each review — but a rate-limit banner rewrite also advances updated_at
#                          without reviewing anything, and a slow review of an older HEAD rewrites it after the
#                          next push, so neither must read as "reviewed". On gemini review rows:
#                          the REST review's commit_id vs headRefOid (submittedAt > last_push_at only as fallback
#                          when the mapping is unavailable) — a straggler or slow review of an older HEAD
#                          surfaces as is_new but must not read as current-HEAD (see PITFALL 6)
#   is_rate_limited        walkthrough body carries CR's dedicated rate-limit banner marker (same match as
#                          quota_alerts) — the current walkthrough is a rate-limit notice, not a review
#   is_ack                 reviewer acknowledgment of a fix or inline reply (never actionable): body carries a
#                          <review_comment_addressed>/<review_comment_withdrawn> marker or starts with "### Summary"
#   cr_markers             CodeRabbit tag tokens found in the first 300 chars of a body (literal match):
#                            potential_issue "_⚠️ Potential issue"     major     "_🟠 Major"
#                            refactor        "_🛠️ Refactor suggestion" minor     "_🟡 Minor"

#   severity_alt           Gemini severity or Codex "Pn Badge" from the inline badge image alt text
#   has_pass_marker        Gemini review summary carries no actionable opinion: "LGTM" / "no issues found" /
#                          a "no [adjective] feedback" clause (covers "no feedback to provide", "no additional
#                          feedback", "no feedback is provided"; any case) / word "approved" (any case), or body
#                          is empty aside from the "## Code Review" heading (any case). Gemini-only; an unmatched
#                          summary is treated as still actionable (safe default — no silent pass).
#   has_started            Codex has posted eyes on the PR or an @codex review trigger comment, or a
#                          clean-pass comment; reactions count only when the reactor is
#                          chatgpt-codex-connector[bot] — anyone else's eyes never register
#   has_outside_diff       CodeRabbit review body carries one or more "Outside diff range
#                          comments" that could not be posted as inline comments
#   has_body_finding       Codex review body itself carries a P0-P3 finding badge; this shape
#                          has no guaranteed inline copy
#   preview                first 120 chars of body after stripping HTML comments and markdown images, whitespace
#                          collapsed — the eyeball safety net for flag misparses (flag vs preview conflict => fetch
#                          full body via query.sh details and trust the body)
#
# SNAPSHOT SCHEMA — same tree as the index, except: `other_comments`/`comments`/`reviews`/
#   `inline_comments_by_user` are FULL lists (no new/history split) with full `body` and `is_new`
#   on every row, walkthrough keeps `body`, `commits` is the full list, own_trigger_comments
#   keeps `body`, `codeql_checks` is the full row list ({name, app, status, conclusion,
#   started_at, is_failing}) instead of the summary, plus top-level `repo` and `generated_at`
#   for query.sh provenance.
#
# PITFALLS
#
# 1. last_push_at uses head commit committedDate, NOT pushedDate.
#    pushedDate is null on the PR's head commit — GitHub's PR API doesn't surface push event time
#    here. committedDate is the most reliable timestamp available.
#
# 2. is_new uses `created_at > last_push_at`, NOT `commit_id == head`.
#    CodeRabbit's old inline comments get their commit_id advanced when it re-reviews a new HEAD
#    (in-place edit or thread re-link — exact mechanism unconfirmed). created_at is per-comment-stable.
#
# 3. REST vs GraphQL bot login strings are NOT interchangeable.
#    GraphQL `author.login` = "coderabbitai" (no [bot] suffix).
#    REST    `user.login`   = "coderabbitai[bot]" (with [bot] suffix).
#    This script uses both endpoints; downstream consumers must use the right form for each datum.
#
# 4. Trigger-command dedup matches comments that START with the command (case-insensitive,
#    leading spaces/tabs tolerated, trailing text allowed). Prefix matching — not full-line —
#    so a human-issued "/gemini review (re: security fix)" still registers for dedup, while
#    a comment merely MENTIONING a command mid-text does not (substring matching would
#    swallow pushback comments that quote a command, silently suppressing real triggers).
#    Leading whitespace is [ \t] only, NOT \s: \s matches \n, which would also register a
#    command sitting on the second line after a blank first line — keep the matcher aligned
#    with the documented contract (command at the very start of the comment).
#
# 5. Codex completion has four observed GitHub shapes: a review tied to the current commit,
#    an empty-body COMMENTED review tied to that commit, a top-level clean-pass comment with
#    `Reviewed commit`, or a +1 PR reaction after the last push. Keep all four: automatic
#    review follows fix pushes and may use
#    different shapes depending on whether it found another P0/P1 issue.
#    The PR reaction is mutable: a new review replaces the previous +1 with eyes, naturally
#    invalidating the previous pass while the current HEAD is under review.
#
# 6. Timestamp alone misses stragglers: a comment created between a poll and the looper's
#    next push sorts before the refreshed last_push_at and would otherwise never surface as
#    new. The seen ledger closes that window: an id no earlier poll has observed is new
#    regardless of timestamp. First poll of a PR (no ledger yet) uses the timestamp rule
#    alone so pre-loop history stays folded; reactions have no stable identity across
#    replacement and stay timestamp-only. The ledger only ever grows within a PR, and is
#    advanced only after the index has been stored and printed — an id acknowledged before
#    a successful emission would fold the straggler into history unseen. is_new therefore
#    means "surface this content", not "reviewed the current HEAD" — head-freshness stays
#    timestamp/commit-based (reviewed_current_head).
#    (This shrinks the miss window; the final-gate `unacked` sweep remains the backstop.)
#
# 7. security_alerts.open_introduced subtracts default-branch open alerts by alert number.
#    The merge-ref analysis covers the whole codebase, so pre-existing alerts (e.g. scheduled
#    Trivy scans on main) would otherwise block the exit gate forever. Alert numbers are
#    repo-global and identical across refs, so a set difference on number is exact.
#
# 8. A batch disposed entirely by pushback pushes nothing, so last_push_at stands still and
#    the timestamp half of is_new would keep re-surfacing the same comments as new every poll
#    until the next push. round.sh mark stamps marked_at on every disposed batch; the freshness
#    watermark is max(last_push_at, last marked_at), so a marked batch retires without a push.
#    Stragglers created between the last poll and the mark are still caught by the seen ledger.
#    Head-freshness (reviewed_current_head, reactions) stays push-based, and a review or
#    comment row with reviewed_current_head == true stays listed (is_new false) after the
#    mark retires it, so the current-HEAD status is still recoverable from the index.
#
# 9. CodeRabbit submits a review object (with a commit anchor) on the first pass only. Every
#    later push gets an incremental review that rewrites the walkthrough comment in place and
#    submits no new review, so the latest review's commit stays pinned to the first reviewed
#    HEAD and can never equal a later head. The walkthrough body is the anchor that moves:
#    its `change_assessment_commit` marker, its "📥 Commits" range line ("between <a> and
#    <b>", b = reviewed head), and its `final_review_risk_coverage` coveredCommitId all name
#    the reviewed head. walkthrough_head reads those (in that order) and takes precedence
#    over the review anchor; the review anchor is only the fallback when the body has none.
